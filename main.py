'''
In this assignment you need to:

    1. automatically classify a 300mX300m region of the AHN4 point cloud into ground and non-ground using the CSF algorithm
    2. make a raster DTM using both kriging and Laplace interpolation
    3. compare your DTM rasters with the official AHN4 DTM raster
    4. to help with visualisation youâ€™ll have to implement a contouring algorithm

You have to use the following Python libraries (others are not accepted, or ask me first): numpy, startinpy, pyinterpolate, rasterio, scipy, laspy, fiona, shapely.
